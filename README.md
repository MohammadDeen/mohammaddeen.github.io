# Hi there, I'm Mohammad Deen! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a trained biomedical scientist with a focus on translational medicine and a passion for computer science and bioinformatics. I am currently a doctoral candidate at the Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Erlangen, and a member of CRC1181. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## Research Interest
At University Hospital Erlangen, my PhD research delves into chronic inflammatory skin conditions, aiming to decipher genetic factors through cutting-edge sequencing techniques. Building on my Master's foundation in Biomedical Science, my current efforts integrate wet lab experimentation with bioinformatics analysis, fostering my growth in both disciplines. Through meticulous study and collaboration, I aim to identify genes and pathways pivotal in skin inflammation and immune response.
