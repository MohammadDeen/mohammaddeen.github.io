I am a trained [biomedical scientist](http://www.medlife.uni-kiel.de/en?set_language=en) with a focus on translational medicine and a passion for computer science and bioinformatics.

I am currently a doctoral candidate at the Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Erlangen and member of CRC1181(https://www.sfb1181.forschung.fau.eu/) [AG Hueffmeier Lab] @ Institute of Human Genetics.

## Research Interest
At Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, my PhD research delves into chronic inflammatory skin conditions, aiming to decipher genetic factors through cutting-edge sequencing techniques. Building on my Master's foundation in Biomedicine from The University of Kiel, I leverage next-generation sequencing particularly Whole genome, whole exome and RNA sequencing among others.
            My current efforts integrate wet lab experimentation with bioinformatics analysis, fostering my growth in both disciplines. Through meticulous study and collaboration, I aim to identify genes and pathways pivotal in skin inflammation, ultimately guiding the development of more effective treatments and enhancing patient care.
